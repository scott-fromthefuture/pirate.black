# This repository is a demo static website for the Pirate Chain Network

The demo can be veiwed at [https://scott-fromthefuture.github.io/pirate.black/](https://scott-fromthefuture.github.io/pirate.black/). 
<br /><br />
The main intent of this demo was to create a static website that is automated, low maintenence, and open to the community. 

- Pure HTML, CSS, and minimal JS 
- low maintenance, no plugins or anything to keep updated
- small, only aroudn 12mb
- Hostable on github (no server costs or maintenence required)
- sits nicely behind cloudflare or other free CDN for a very fast site (once optimized)
- git provides Chain of custody, versioning, and handles permissions (no more wondering who has access)
- ultra portable - can be hosted anywhere - no database to move
- can be hosted easily on alternative networks like IPFS or Qortal
- disaster resilient - if a host is shutdown, the DNS can simply be pointed to any other copy (gitlab mirror for example)
- makes the website opensource open to the copmmunity being on git
- If self-hosted, can use git hook so source remains open
- becuase on git and simple HTML so anybody can PR
- automated, all links and content  update automatically so no manual interaction is needed - helps prevent site from looking abandoned in slow times
- Jekeyl was used for templating and extra functionality
-A translation system was built using Jekyll and python scripts which scrape the english version and use DeepL API to create transalted static pages in the `lang` directory. 

The drawback from going to a static website however is that there is no database for things like a self hosted blog platform, or CMS for people to make changes to content graphically. Ultimately it was decided to go with a more complete server with a site and blog system built on wordpress
<br /><br />
## ## This Demo is UNFINISHED. Some features were not complete. Do not rely on the scripts or any info on the website. The static website is in the `_site` directory, which are the only files from this repository needed for the static website.
